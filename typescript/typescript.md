ctrl + space will show all auto complete options


Colons after variables or parameters are how you specify a type for that variable or constant. 

`|` is used to create a union type (multiple accepted types)

Hovering over a variable with show you it's type. Hovering over a function will show you it's parameter's types as well as the type of it's return. 
tl;dr hovering in TS shows you handy stuff. 

There is still just one type `number` for integers and floats. 

`any` as a type pretty much negates the purpose and benefit of using TS. 

You can specify what type a function should return. 

You can specify what types of data can be stored in an array like so `let favoriteActivites: string[]` (an array of strings). 

`enums` are cool and very useful for creating keys with corresponding numerical ids. 

If you give something a type of function you can specify what types its params should be as well as what type it's return should be. 

If you specify that a callback param will be a function you can still do the same as above^.
