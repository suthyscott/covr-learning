JIT (Just in Time) is now built into Tailwind 3.0. This allows Tailwind to only interpret and compile the classes that are actually being used in the active files. Hence lightning fast load times and extremely lightweight css build files. 

Tailwind's preprocessor actually strips away default styling, therefore guaranteeing consistent appearance across browsers and other environments.
